#  BookTime a CS50x - Final Project

 
Hello, my name is Gabriele Mora, Iâ€™m from Cividate Camuno a small city in Italy.

The platform integrates with the New York Times API to showcase trending bestsellers in both fiction and non-fiction categories and use the Google Book API for all the books cover and all the books information available in the project.
